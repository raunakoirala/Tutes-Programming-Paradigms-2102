# Programming Paradigms Learning Journey

## Weeks 1-6
In the initial six weeks of this course, we focused on TypeScript (TS), RxJS, observables, pure functions, and handling asynchronous behavior. We learned how to write clean and maintainable code in TypeScript, utilize RxJS to handle asynchronous operations, and apply the concept of pure functions for predictable behavior in our programs.

## Weeks 7-12
During the latter half of the course (weeks 7-12), we transitioned to Haskell, diving into parsing, abstractions of logic, and building complexity using types and pure functions in a declarative style. This phase of the course emphasized functional programming paradigms and how Haskell's strong type system empowers developers to write robust and expressive code.

## Programming Paradigms Exploration

Throughout this course, we explored various programming paradigms and delved into their unique attributes. Our learning journey involved:

1. **Differentiating Programming Paradigms**: We learned to distinguish between programming paradigms, understanding how imperative, functional, and declarative styles influence code structure and design.

2. **Language Analysis**: We studied the major programming languages, analyzing their features, strengths, and weaknesses. We explored how these languages evolved over time and their historical significance in the world of computing.

3. **Critique of Languages**: We critically assessed past, present, and future programming languages, discussing their contributions to the software development landscape and their relevance in contemporary contexts.

4. **Paradigm Suitability**: We evaluated the suitability of different paradigms for solving various types of problems. This involved considering factors like problem complexity, maintainability, and performance.

5. **Multilingual Proficiency**: We gained experience in designing and implementing programs in multiple programming languages, including both procedural and non-procedural paradigms. This allowed us to solve complex problems using diverse approaches.

6. **Theory Application**: We explored the theoretical aspects of modern programming paradigms and applied this knowledge to analyze and design programs. Understanding the underlying principles helped us make informed design decisions.

This course equipped us with a broad perspective on programming paradigms, enabling us to choose the most suitable approach for solving real-world problems and fostering a deeper understanding of the principles that underlie programming languages and paradigms.
